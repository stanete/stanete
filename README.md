I like to think I'm a [Product Minded Software Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/). I love leading teams which build products that add [value](https://stanete.com/focus-on-value). Get to know me better by reading some stuff I wrote:

- ðŸ“ˆ [Compound Returns on Engineering Excellence](https://stanete.com/compound-returns-engineering-excellence)
- ðŸ”¥ [How to survive working at a startup](https://stanete.com/survive-working-startup)

I think any Software Engineer should understand at least the basics of System Design, no matter their seniority or if their specialty is frontend, backend or mobile. Read my series about this topic:
